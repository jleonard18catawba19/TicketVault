# TicketVault

Ticket Vault 

This was an app that was created from Android BootCamp. 
I used the KitKat Version, so it should be compatable with Android devices that allow Kitkat.
You will Insert the Number of Tickets you will need.
We used a Spinner and Strings in this App.
Strigs allowed us to insert TextBoxes with Hints.
Once you Insert the number of Ticket you will choose a band from the drop down menu and click find the cost.
